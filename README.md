Creating a chatbot with google open source llm
# First you have to get an google api key with which you are going to access the models 
# You can create one in Google AI Studio
-> file11.py is one loop conversation with the gemini model, a simple way to connect with the model with an api key

-> file12.py is with many loops, so you can create a full conversation with the ai agent (gemini model) and can exit the loop with keyword 'exit'

-> file13.py is an updated version of file12.py, but with added memory and with a new conversation chain to create an chain of interactions with ai agent (it has an error with the runnable instance of the model)
